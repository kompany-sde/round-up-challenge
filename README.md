This is a  “round-up”   feature   for   Starling   customers   using   their   public
developer   API   that   is   available   to   all   customers   and   partners.

For   a   customer,   take   all   the   transactions   in   a   given   week   and   round   them   up   to   the   nearest  £
pound.   For   example   with   spending   of   £4.35,   £5.20   and   £0.87,   the   round-up   would   be   £1.58.  
This   amount   should   then   be   transferred   into   a  savings   goal - https://www.starlingbank.com/blog/introducing-goals/,   helping   the   customer   save   for
future   adventures.
